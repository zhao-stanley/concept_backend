Removed Board/user from Problem concept, as I'll be mocking up data (too complicated to implement), and they serve purposes that are not necessarily a fullblown concept. Also updated the problem concept properties to better represent the coordinate system I'm using for the holds and to also support different board angles.

I'm also working on implementing an API layer that uses the generic concepts to interact with the backend.
