# Revised concept: Filter \[Item]

```
concept Filter [Item]

purpose
    provide a reusable mechanism for dynamically filtering collections of items based on multiple criteria

principle
    given a collection of items and a set of filtering criteria,
    applying the filter returns only items that match all specified criteria.

state
    // The Filter concept itself is stateless and operates solely on the inputs provided to its actions.
    // It does not maintain persistent state for filters or criteria.

actions
    search(items: set of Items, criteria: mapping from String to set of Strings): (results: set of Items)
        requires:
            // The 'items' argument must be a collection of objects, each possessing an '_id' of type Item
            // and potentially other properties that can be matched against the 'criteria'.
            // The 'criteria' argument must be a map from string keys to sets of string values.
        effect:
            Examine each item in the provided 'items' collection.
            For an item to be included in the 'results', it must satisfy all conditions specified
            in the 'criteria'. A criterion 'key: {v1, v2}' is satisfied if the item has a property
            corresponding to 'key' and its value (or any of its values if it's an array) matches
            at least one of {v1, v2}.
            Return the set of '_id's of all items that satisfy all criteria.
            If 'criteria' is empty, all items are returned.
