# response:

You're right! My apologies. The errors fall into two categories:

1. **TypeScript's strictness on `unknown` types in `catch` blocks (TS18046):** This is a common issue with newer TypeScript versions where `catch` variables are typed as `unknown`. To access properties like `message`, you must first narrow the type (e.g., check if it's an `Error` instance).
2. **Lack of type narrowing after `assertObjectMatch` in tests (TS2339):** While `assertObjectMatch` conceptually confirms the structure, TypeScript's static analysis doesn't automatically narrow the type. An explicit `if ("error" in result)` check is needed.

Here's the corrected code for both the concept implementation and the test file:
