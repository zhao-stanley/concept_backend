# response:

You are correct! My apologies, there was a subtle syntax error in several `console.log` statements related to string interpolation.

**Problem:**
The closing of interpolated arrays within template literals in `console.log` messages was incorrect, leading to mismatched brackets or parentheses.

Specifically:

* `[${values.join(", "})]} ` should be `[${values.join(", ")}]}`
* `{category: ["electronics", "apparel"]})` should be `{category: ["electronics", "apparel"]}` or `{category: ["electronics", "apparel"]]}` if it intends to display the array within brackets. Given the previous example, it likely intended to simply display the content as `[value1, value2]`.

**Fix:**
I will correct these `console.log` statements to properly close the array interpolation.

Here's the updated `src/concepts/Filter/FilterConcept.test.ts` with these changes:
