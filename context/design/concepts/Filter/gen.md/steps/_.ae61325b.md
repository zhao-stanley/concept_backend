# Concept Testing

Testing concepts involves primarily:

1. Confirming that for each action:
   * **requires** is satisfied: if a variety of test cases that do not fulfill the requirement are tested against the concept, they do not succeed (or return a record with an `error:` key).
   * **effects** is satisfied: after the action is performed, we can verify that the state did indeed change according to the effect (or the return is correctly specified).
2. Ensuring that the **principle** is fully modeled by the actions:
   * Demonstrate that the series of actions described in the **principle**, when performed, result in the specified behavior or updates to state.
