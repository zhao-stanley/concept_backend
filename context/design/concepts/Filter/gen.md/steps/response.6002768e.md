# response:

You're absolutely right! TypeScript is being particular about ensuring type safety. Even though you're asserting that `result` should match an `{ error: string }` object, TypeScript's static analysis doesn't automatically narrow the type of `result` based on `assertObjectMatch`. It still sees `result` as `Promise<{ results: Item[] } | { error: string }>`.

To resolve this, we need to explicitly check if the `error` property exists on the `result` object, similar to how it's done for other action calls in your tests. This acts as a type guard, allowing TypeScript to correctly infer the type of `result` within that `if` block.

Here's the corrected part of the test file:
