   *   in the 'criteria'. A criterion 'key: {v1, v2}' is satisfied if the item has a property
   *   corresponding to 'key' and its value (or any of its values if it's an array) matches
   *   at least one of {v1, v2}.

   *   If 'criteria' is empty, all items are returned.

## `FilterConcept` Test Implementation (Updated)

The test file is adjusted to reflect the stateless nature of the `Filter` concept. Actions for `createFilter`, `addCriteria`, and `clearFilter` are removed. All tests now directly call the `search` action, providing items and criteria as arguments. The `Principle Trace` is also updated to reflect this new flow.
