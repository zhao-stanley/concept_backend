# response:

You're right, the concept of a persistent `Filter` entity stored in the database is being dropped. The `Filter` concept should become a utility layer that takes a collection of items and a set of criteria and returns the filtered items. This aligns well with the "completeness of functionality" by making the `Filter` concept responsible only for the *logic* of filtering, not the storage of filters or items.

Here's the updated `Filter` concept specification, implementation, and test file based on this new approach.
