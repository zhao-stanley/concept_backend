# Trace: Filter Principle Fulfillment

**Principle:** after adding search criteria to a filter, applying it to a collection returns only items matching all specified criteria

This trace demonstrates the `Filter` concept fulfilling its principle through a sequence of actions:

1. **Create a filter**:
   * An `createFilter()` action is performed, returning a new, unique `filterId`. The concept's state is updated to include this new filter with no criteria.
   * `console.log` output will confirm the new filter ID.

2. **Add search criteria to the filter**:
   * Multiple `addCriteria()` actions are performed on the newly created `filterId`.
     * `addCriteria(filterId, "category", ["electronics", "apparel"])`
     * `addCriteria(filterId, "brand", ["Apple", "Samsung"])`
     * `addCriteria(filterId, "in_stock", ["true"])`
   * The concept's state (the `criteria` map for `filterId`) is progressively updated to include these criteria.
   * `console.log` output will show each criterion as it's added.

3. **Prepare a collection of items**:
   * A `TestFilterableItem[]` array is created, containing several sample items. These items include a mix of:
     * Items that *fully match* all three criteria (e.g., an "Apple Watch" that is "electronics", "Apple", and `in_stock: true`).
     * Items that mismatch one or more criteria (e.g., a "Sony Headphones" where "brand" is "Sony", not "Apple" or "Samsung").
     * Items that mismatch due to type/value (e.g., "Samsung TV" where `in_stock: false`).
     * Items that mismatch due to missing properties (e.g., "Old T-Shirt" missing `in_stock`).
   * This collection is created in memory *outside* the `Filter` concept's persistent state, as the `Filter` concept itself does not manage the items being filtered, only the criteria.
   * `console.log` output will list the prepared items.

4. **Apply the filter to the collection**:
   * A `search()` action is performed: `search(filterId, items)`.
   * The `Filter` concept retrieves the criteria associated with `filterId` from its state.
   * It then iterates through the provided `items` array, checking each item against *all* the stored criteria. An item must satisfy *every* criterion to be included in the results. For each criterion, an item property value (which can be a single string or an array of strings) must *overlap* with the filter's required values for that criterion key.
   * `console.log` output will indicate the start of the search.

5. **Verify results**:
   * The `results` returned by the `search` action (an array of `Item` IDs) are compared against the expected `ID`s of the items known to match all the criteria.
   * `assertEquals` is used to confirm that only the items that fulfill *all* the `category`, `brand`, and `in_stock` criteria are present in the `results`.
   * `console.log` output will display the expected and actual matching IDs, confirming the principle is upheld.

This trace comprehensively tests the core functionality of the `Filter` concept, demonstrating its purpose and principle by showing how criteria are defined and then correctly applied to a collection of items.

You are an expert pair programmer. This is where I'll pair program with you, providing you feedback using your original implementation and testing script provided as context.

The type errors have seem to be resolved, but there are test failures. I have provided the stack trace below:

* 6 timers were started in this test, but never completed. This is often caused by not calling `clearTimeout`.
