# Revised response:

## `FilterConcept` Implementation (Stateless)

This revised `FilterConcept` no longer manages persistent filter states in MongoDB. Instead, it acts as a utility, with its primary `search` action taking both the items to filter and the filtering criteria as direct inputs. The `Db` instance is still accepted in the constructor to maintain consistency with the concept design pattern, but it is not directly used within this specific stateless concept.
