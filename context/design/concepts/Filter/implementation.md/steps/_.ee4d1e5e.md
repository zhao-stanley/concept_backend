# Dictionaries as arguments and results

Note that the arguments and results of actions are always dictionaries. For example if an action in a specification has the signature

```
action (a: A, b: B): (c: C)
```

this means that the implementation should take a dictionary with fields named `a` and `b`, and return a dictionary with a field `c`. Error results are returned as a dictionary with a field `error` which is generally a string:

```
action (a: A, b: B): (error: string)
```

Queries always return an array of dictionaries so if the specification has this signature:

```
\_query (a: A, b: B): (c: C)
\_query (a: A, b: B): (error: string)
```

the implementation should return an array of dictionaries each with a field called `c` or, in the error case, a dictionary with a field `error` of type string. Note also that a query, unlike an action, can return a nested dictionary. For example, given this state

```
	a set of Groups with
	  a users set of User

	a set of Users with
	  a username String
	  a password String
```

the query specification

```
	\_getUsersWithUsernamesAndPasswords (group: Group) : (user: {username: String, password: String})
    **requires** group exists
    **effects** returns set of all users in the group each with its username and password
```

says that the query should return an array of dictionaries, each with a `user` field that holds a dictionary with a `username` and `password` field.
