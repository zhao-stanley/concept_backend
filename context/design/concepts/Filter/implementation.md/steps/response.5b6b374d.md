        a filterId String
        a criteria mapping from String to set of Strings  // key-value search criteria

actions
    createFilter(): (filter: Filter)
        effect:
            generate unique filterId
            create filter with empty criteria
            return the created filter

    addCriteria(filter: Filter, key: String, values: set of Strings)
        requires:
            filter exists
        effect:
            add or update criteria[key] = values in filter

    search(filter: Filter, items: set of Items): (results: set of Items)
        requires:
            filter exists
        effect:
            return items that match all criteria in filter

    clearFilter(filter: Filter)
