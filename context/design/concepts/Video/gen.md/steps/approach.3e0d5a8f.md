# approach: steps to testing

The following prefix format for header 1 blocks denote the relevant steps:

* `# file: src/{name}/{name}Concept.test.ts`
  * The test file for the concept
* `# trace:`
  * Describes a full trace of actions, such as how the principle is fulfilled.

After the concept specification and file, create another test file that properly tests the concept, and propose how the trace might work.
