# approach: steps to implementation

The following prefix format for header 1 blocks denote the relevant steps:

* `# concept: {name}`
  * A specification of the concept we're looking to implement
* `# file: src/{name}/{name}Concept.ts`
  * The implementation of the concept class as a TypeScript code block
* `# problem:`
  * Description of any issues that arise with running/operating the implementation
* `# solution:`
  * A proposed solution, followed by any updates through a `# file:` block
